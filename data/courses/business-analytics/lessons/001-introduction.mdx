## What is Business Analytics?

Business analytics is the practice of iterative, methodical exploration of an
organization's data, with an emphasis on statistical analysis. It is used by
companies committed to data-driven decision making.

<KeyConcept title="Data-Driven Decision Making">
  The process of making organizational decisions based on actual data rather
  than intuition or observation alone.
</KeyConcept>

## Types of Business Analytics

Business analytics can be categorized into four main types:

### 1. Descriptive Analytics

- **What happened?**
- Summarizes historical data to understand past performance
- Uses dashboards, reports, and data visualization

<Example>
  A retail company analyzing last quarter's sales data to understand which
  products performed best and in which regions.
</Example>

### 2. Diagnostic Analytics

- **Why did it happen?**
- Examines data to understand the causes of past outcomes
- Uses drill-down, data mining, and correlations

### 3. Predictive Analytics

- **What will happen?**
- Uses statistical models and machine learning to forecast future outcomes
- Employs regression analysis, time series analysis, and predictive modeling

### 4. Prescriptive Analytics

- **What should we do?**
- Recommends actions based on data analysis
- Uses optimization algorithms and simulation

## The Business Analytics Process

The typical business analytics process follows these steps:

1. **Define the Problem**: Clearly articulate the business question
