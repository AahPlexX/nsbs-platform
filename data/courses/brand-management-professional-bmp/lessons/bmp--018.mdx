## The Communicative Dimensions of Brand Communication

### Beyond Messaging to Strategic Communication

Consider an organization developing brand communication. Each communication presents messaging elements, yet the most successful communications create strategic communication that influences understanding and relationship development. This communicative dimension represents the strategic aspect of brand communication—the capacity to establish communication channels that create understanding while maintaining relationship relevance.

Brand communication at its communicative best represents more than messaging design; it embodies strategic communication creation and relationship development. It answers fundamental questions about how brands establish communication channels, how they create understanding, and how they influence engagement. These communicative dimensions create brand relevance that transcends messaging considerations and contributes directly to brand equity.

Consider organizations with sophisticated brand communication. Apple has demonstrated how communication transcends messaging design to create global understanding and relationship development through strategic communication creation. Microsoft has demonstrated how communication transcends messaging reference to create market dominance and customer loyalty through strategic communication development. These communication approaches create brand relevance that persists through competitive pressures and market disruptions.

The communicative dimensions of brand communication operate through multiple mechanisms—communication creation, understanding establishment, and relationship development—that create communicative advantage that persists through market challenges and competitive pressures. Organizations that create effective communication creation create understanding that informs strategic decisions. Organizations that create effective understanding establishment create insights that guide communication strategy. Organizations that create effective relationship development creates advantage that drives brand performance.

### The Evolution of Brand Communication Thinking

Communicatively, brand communication has evolved through distinct phases that reflect changing market conditions and communication expectations. These phases include message-based, channel-based, and experience-based approaches—each creating opportunities for organizations to create communicative relevance while maintaining market advantage.

The message-based approach represents the earliest phase of brand communication thinking. Organizations focus on message design and content elements to establish market presence. This approach creates visibility that influences initial market consideration while providing baseline understanding of brand capabilities.

Consider how the message-based approach operates across different organizations. In consumer goods, organizations develop brand communication through message design (content, tone) and content elements (copy, visuals) to establish market presence. In technology, organizations develop product communication through message design (content, tone) and content elements (copy, visuals) to establish market presence. In services, organizations develop service communication through message design (content, tone) and content elements (copy, visuals) to establish market presence. These communication approaches create visibility that influences initial market consideration while providing baseline understanding.

The message-based approach has evolved through multiple iterations. Early versions focused on simple message design and content elements. Later versions incorporated channel-based elements and communication consistency. Contemporary versions integrate experience-based approaches and strategic communication to create comprehensive brand communication. These evolutions create communicative capabilities that persist through market challenges and competitive disruptions.

### The Strategic Importance of Messaging Strategy

Communicatively, messaging strategy represents one of the most important aspects of brand communication. Organizations must establish comprehensive messaging strategies that ensure understanding while maintaining relationship development and brand value. This understanding creates communicative advantage that influences brand performance and market positioning.

Consider how messaging strategy operates across different organizations. In consumer goods, organizations establish messaging strategies that ensure understanding across product categories, market segments, and customer touchpoints to maintain relationship development and brand value. In technology, organizations establish messaging strategies that ensure understanding across product lines, technology
