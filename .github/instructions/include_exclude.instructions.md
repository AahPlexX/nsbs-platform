### Finer Details
- "author" always = "The National Society of Business Sciences"
**ALL courses = Self-paced, text-based courses

- all courses will have a single 100 question multiple choice exam at the end (after the student has completed all lessons) 
   - pass = =>80/100 MCQs
   - fail = < 80/100 MCQs
   - All individual course purchases come with two (2) exam attempts
       - **only if** the userId fails both attemptId for courseID will the ability to purchase an additional voucherId @ cost = $149 become available
- Never bundle courses
- NO subscriptions
- NO gamification or leaderboards or community forums
- certificateId is generated for userId **only when** userId has "passed" examId/courseId 
     - certicateId is **only then** -> viewable and printable from **success page (onyl viewable immediately after passing** and then the userId's user dashboard

- COMPLETION = STUDENT HAS MARKED EVERY "LESSON" AS COMPLETE
   - lessonId = sequential numbers
   - lessonId  completion = progress tracking
   -- The (user) is solely responsible for manually confirming the :lesson is complete via the "Mark lesson complete button"
   -- **BECAUSE NO DURATION FOR COURSE STUDY **WE ARE 100% SELF-PACED, NO EXPIRATION, NO DURATION, NO TIME ASSOCIATIONS FOR THE AMOUTN OF TIME STUDIED -- THE ONLY LOGICAL IMPLEMENTATION IS TO ONLY USE THE SELF-CONFIRMATION BY THE USER FOR "LESSON COMPLETE" --THIS IS THEN ADDED TO THE COURSEID PROGRESS TRACKER--*LOCATED IN THE USERID DASHBOARD (I.E. COURSENAME AKA ID = LESSON PROGRESS: (XX/YY))
-- LESSONID ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE SEQUENTIALLY COMPLETED *THE USER CAN ACCESS ALL LESSONS IMMEDIATELY, HOWEVER THE EXAM IS NOT ACCESSIBLE UNTIL XX/XX OF COURSEID/LESSONID'S HAVE BEEN MARKED COMPLETE
**IMPORTANT: Lessons are intended to be sequentially progressed through, however, this is not a firm requirement - the [user] is permitted to mark different lessonId's as "complete" out-of-order, the main point is that the final exam is not accessible until xx/xx lessonId's are marked "complete"
