### Current Product Status

- **Development Phase**: Under Active Remediation (Critical Issues Discovered)
- **Technical Maturity**: 6.2/10 (Major compilation issues requiring fixes)
- **Security Compliance**: Framework in place but compilation prevents deployment
- **Performance**: Architecture designed for scale but needs error resolution
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strictness revealed 98 compilation errors requiring systematic fixes

## Critical Issues Discovered (December 2024)

### Compilation Status
- **TypeScript Errors**: 98 errors discovered across 46 files
- **Missing Dependencies**: 27 critical UI packages were missing (now resolved)
- **Type Safety**: Widespread 'any' type usage violating strict mode
- **Async Patterns**: Incorrect Supabase client usage patterns throughout codebase

### Infrastructure Issues
- **Build Status**: ❌ Failed compilation prevents production deployment
- **Dependency Management**: ✅ Missing packages now installed
- **Type Definitions**: ⏳ In progress - systematic 'any' type elimination
- **Database Integration**: ⏳ Async pattern corrections applied to 6+ files

### Resolution Progress
- **Error Reduction**: 98 → ~30 errors (68% improvement)
- **Dependencies**: Complete Radix UI ecosystem installed
- **Supabase Patterns**: Server-side client creation patterns corrected
- **Admin Dashboard**: Completely rebuilt with proper typing
